        <h2>Progress Report for Ishaan Ahuja</h2>

        <h4>Week 2:</h4>
          <b>Date: </b>08/30<br>
          <b>Total hours: </b>15<br>
          <b>Description of design efforts: </b><br>Began work on interfacing our chosen MCU STM32F051R8T6 due to familiarity from Rtvik, Abhay and Pratyakshâ€™s ECE 362. Currently interfacing the TMP36 and LDRs with the MCU using ADC channels 0 and 1 on Eclipse, and reading up more on STM32 architecture using the architecture manual from the ECE 362 website, as well as the datasheet for identifying the pins and available peripherals. Due to unfamiliarity with the STM, I will need to do more homework on calibrating values, as well as validating the data from the debug output. We will need to procure a heat gun/blow dryer to test the data.<br>

        <h4>Week 3:</h4>
          <b>Date: </b>09/06<br>
          <b>Total hours: </b>14<br>
          <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
          <b>What I worked on this week: </b>Interfaced the TCRT 5000 Infrared sensors successfully with the STM32F0 MCU. It is currently being tested using the Debugger mode, and reflects a voltage change upon object detection. Also spent some time refining the temperature sensor value flickers using a refined algorithm.<br>
          <b>Things I learned this week: </b>I learned more about programming peripherals using ADC, Timers, and GPIO with STM32 as I had not encountered this in my ECE 362 microcontroller which used 9S12.<br>
          <b>Challenges: </b>It was initially difficult to interface the STM32 due to unfamiliarity with the micro, but it went smoothly after assistance from the staff and my teammates. I also learned to use the System Workbench properly, with the debugger mode, some assembly programming, and keeping track of variables and registers.<br>
          <b>Next week's tasks: </b>Next week will need simultaneous running of the STM32 peripherals TMP36 and the IR sensor, and if time permits the photoresistor also in that order. Below is an image of the TCRT 5000 circuit I have set up.<br>

        <h4>Week 4:</h4>
          <b>Date: </b>09/13<br>
          <b>Total hours: </b>11<br>
          <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br> 
          <b>What I worked on this week: </b>Finished up the TMP36 temperature sensor ADC code and demoed a debugger version to Dr. Thottethodi and GTA. It was working satisfactorily but they vetoed against the heat gun for test due to possibility of damaging the plastics.<br>
          <b>Things I learned this week: </b>I learned more about Timers in preparation for running asynchronous tasks and interrupt handlers.<br>
          <b>Challenges: </b>Unfamiliarity with the timer modules and IRQ handlers on STM32.<br>
          <b>Next week's tasks: </b>I will begin work on the Timers and running both the TMP36 and the IR Sensors together. The circuit for the LDR is to be changed as below.<br>

		    <h4>Week 5:</h4>
          <b>Date: </b>09/20<br>
          <b>Total hours: </b>7<br>
          <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br> 
          <b>What I worked on this week: </b>I started working on USART to help Abhay since he was having problems with transmitting and receiving data from the STM32 and the computer terminal. We were able to successfully debug it and transmitted "HELLO" from the STM32 and received it on the computer terminal and hence now we have a fully functioning USART. I also worked on getting the LDR sensor to send its data to the STM32 using the circuit in the image above and decode it. We will use the LDR sensor for sensing ambient light data and use it to automatically adjust the brightness of the mirror.<br>
          <b>Things I learned this week: </b>I learnt a lot about the USART protocol since I was only familiar with UART.<br>
          <b>Challenges: </b>Unfamiliarity with USART protocol made it difficult to debug but I was familiar with UART so it made it a lot easier to understand the synchronous and asynchronous things used in USART.<br>
          <b>Next week's tasks: </b>I will begin working on integrating the code for USART and will test sending sensor data over it.<br><br>

        <h4>Week 6:</h4>
          <b>Date: </b>09/27<br>
          <b>Total hours: </b>12<br>
          <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br> 
          <b>What I worked on this week: </b>I helped Abhay with the integration of the USART code with the sensor code in STM32. After successful integration, we were able to send 3 sample comma separated integers from the STM32 to the Jetson Nano and received them correctly. I also worked with Rtvik on the Eagle schematic of the project and made a very basic one with STM32 and other sensors with labels inserted.<br>
          <b>Things I learned this week: </b>I learnt a lot this week about PCB schematics and layouts since I have never taken any related course ever. I learnt how to use the PCB design software, Autodesk Eagle, to make the basic schematic of our project with Rtvik.<br>
          <b>Challenges: </b>I never had taken any PCB related course and hence had a lot of trouble understanding the basics of PCB designing but youtube and other online resources helped me to gain a better understanding about the whole process.<br>
          <b>Next week's tasks: </b><br>Rtvik and I will finish up the PCB schematic so that we could get started with the PCB layout.<br>
