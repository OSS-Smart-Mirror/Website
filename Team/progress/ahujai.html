This is an example weekly progress report document that team members can use to report their individual progress
of their ECE477 senior design projects. Weekly progress reports are expected to follow the general guidelines
presented in the "Progress Report Policy" document, available online at https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/Course/Policies/policies.html

Please create 4 copies of this example, renaming each copy to <PurdueID>.html, where <PurdueID> corresponds to
the Purdue ITAP Career Account ID given by Purdue to each individual team member. If you have any questions,
contact course staff.

            <h2>Progress Report for Ishaan Ahuja</h2>

            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 8/30<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 15<br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
Began work on interfacing our chosen MCU STM32F051R8T6 due to familiarity from Rtvik, Abhay and Pratyakshâ€™s ECE 362. Currently interfacing the TMP36 and LDRs with the MCU using ADC channels 0 and 1 on Eclipse, and reading up more on STM32 architecture using the architecture manual from the ECE 362 website, as well as the datasheet for identifying the pins and available peripherals. Due to unfamiliarity with the STM, I will need to do more homework on calibrating values, as well as validating the data from the debug output. We will need to procure a heat gun/blow dryer to test the data.

		  <h4>Week 3:</h4>
                  <b>Date:</b> 9/6-<br>
                  <b>Total hours:</b> 14<br>
                  <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
                  <b> What I worked on this week: </b> Interfaced the TCRT 5000 Infrared sensors successfully with the STM32F0 MCU. It is currently being tested using the Debugger mode, and reflects a voltage change upon object detection. Also spent some time refining the temperature sensor value flickers using a refined algorithm. <br>
                  <b> Things I learned this week: </b> I learned more about programming peripherals using ADC, Timers, and GPIO with STM32 as I had not encountered this in my ECE 362 microcontroller which used 9S12. <br>
                  <b> Challenges: </b> It was initially difficult to interface the STM32 due to unfamiliarity with the micro, but it went smoothly after assistance from the staff and my teammates. I also learned to use the System Workbench properly, with the debugger mode, some assembly programming, and keeping track of variables and registers.<br>
                  <b> Next week's tasks: </b> Next week will need simultaneous running of the STM32 peripherals TMP36 and the IR sensor, and if time permits the photoresistor also in that order. Below is an image of the TCRT 5000 circuit I have set up. <br>

		  <h4>Week 4:</h4>
                  <b>Date:</b> 9/13<br>
                  <b>Total hours:</b> 11<br>
                  <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br> 
                  <b> What I worked on this week: </b> Finished up the TMP36 temperature sensor ADC code and demoed a debugger version to Dr. Thottethodi and GTA. It was working satisfactority but they vetoed against the heat gun for test due to possibility of damaging the plastics.<br>
                  <b> Things I learned this week: </b> I learned more about Timers in preparation for running asynchronous tasks and interrupt handlers.<br>
                  <b> Challenges: </b> Unfamiliarity with the timer modules and IRQ handlers on STM32.<br>
                  <b> Next week's tasks: </b> I will begin work on the Timers and running both the TMP36 and the IR Sensors together. The circuit for the LDR is to be changed as below. <br>
