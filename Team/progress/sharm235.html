            <h4>Week 1 & 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 8/30<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 15<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			Helped with final revision of the project proposal. Understood the design of the system and the way everything is interconnected. Made sure whole team is on the same page by helping with the setup of the github repository along with task tracking.
			Helped with setting up the website and progress reports for the individual team members. Assisted with the functional documentations report as well.
			Brainstormed and came up with an initial system design for the UI. Included basic features (greeting message, time, date, weather, location, quote, etc.) and plan to expand or work around with this design in the coming weeks too. Researched about the different ways we can program the UI: GUI (PyQt, Tkinter, etc.), webapp(django, flask, etc.), dashboards(spotfire, grafana, etc.).
			Looked up the documentation for the different libraries and the different APIs which could be used for the Interface:<br>
			1. Flask: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/<br>
			2. Django: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/<br>
			TODO next week: Research more about the different ways we can code the UI and finalize the software tools and frameworks for the same ASAP. Look into the tutorials for the tools/frameworks which I am unfamiliar with and get started with coding for the initial basic display.
