            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 8/30<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 15<br>
			<b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
			Helped with final revision of the project proposal. Understood the design of the system and the way everything is interconnected. Made sure whole team is on the same page by helping with the setup of the github repository along with task tracking.
			Helped with setting up the website and progress reports for the individual team members. Assisted with the functional documentations report as well.
			Brainstormed and came up with an initial system design for the UI. Included basic features (greeting message, time, date, weather, location, quote, etc.) and plan to expand or work around with this design in the coming weeks too. Researched about the different ways we can program the UI: GUI (PyQt, Tkinter, etc.), webapp(django, flask, etc.), dashboards(spotfire, grafana, etc.).
			Looked up the documentation for the different libraries and the different APIs which could be used for the Interface:<br>
			1. Flask: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/<br>
			2. Django: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/<br>
			TODO next week: Research more about the different ways we can code the UI and finalize the software tools and frameworks for the same ASAP. Look into the tutorials for the tools/frameworks which I am unfamiliar with and get started with coding for the initial basic display.

			<h4>Week 3:</h4>
  			<b>Date:</b> 9/06<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 8<br>
  			<b>What did I work on:</b><br>
  			I worked on finalizing the tools, frameworks and libraries we will be using for the UI. We have decided to go ahead and use the tkinter module which is a wrapper around tk to create a GUI that will be the main smart mirror UI. I read up online tutorials on assigning labels in the GUI, adding widgets and handling various color issues. I started writing some initial code to pull data from different APIs to get the current geolocation and I plan to complete an initial GUI display by next week. I plan to display basic time, weather and location information on the UI to begin with. Then, we will add more things such as user face authentication, etc. which is going to be a crucial part of the smart mirror.<br>
  <b> What did I learn this week:</b><br>
  I realized how important it is to understand and design a system before starting to actually implement the task. I learned about GUI development in Python which I will be using for the UI. I learned about different modules in python that will serve our purpose of getting relevant data for the UI. This will be my first major GUI development project and I will have to split and divide my taks accordingly.<br>
  <b>Challenges:</b><br>
  System design is an area I lack expertise in and it was great to get an idea from the team as to how the whole project will be assembled. I had to get this image clear in order to have a clear overview of my UI expectations. I did encounter some issues while deciding my code structure but I decided to go ahead with Object Oriented Design as I already have experience with the same.<br>
  <b>Next week plan:</b><br>
  The plan for next week is to finish up the initial design for the UI and get a working display. I have to spend time on coding and debugging the GUI and make sure it works.

	<h4>Week 4:</h4>
  			<b>Date:</b> 9/13<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 8<br>
  			<b>What did I work on:</b><br>
  			I began coding the UI for our IntelliFace's frontend. I watched some online tutorials on some GUI's created using the Tkinter module as well. After a lot of researching and having worked on a GUI in the course "ECE 364: Software Engineering for Tools Laboratory" as well, I decided to code the GUI using an Object Oriented Design approach since that is the easiest to manage big code. I wrote code to display the current day, date and time on the top right. Writing this initial code gave me a good overview of how I need to add new features to this GUI with things like location, stocks, news, etc.<br>
  <b> What did I learn this week:</b><br>
   I realized that I do have to spend time planning my code before actually beginning to code the GUI. I need to have a clear picture of what I want to display on the GUI as well. I definitely want to strengthen my GUI development experience and this project will definitely help me to achieve that. I need to plan and divide my work accordingly now in order to have a well designed GUI for the IntelliFace.<br>
  <b>Challenges:</b><br>
  As I said last week, designing a GUI for a system is not a trivial task. I need to now decide how I want to add more features to the GUI and make sure that one feature doesn't overlap with another as that will not give a pleasant display for the frontend I need to look up some more advanced features of the Tkinter module that cna help me minimize my code even more and make my taks even easier.<br>
  <b>Next week plan:</b><br>
  After having got an initial display, I now need to plan and add more features to this GUI such as news, location and stocks. I plan to incorporate this hopefully by end of the next two weeks so that we can have an initial UI prototype for the Intelliface.

	<h4>Week 5:</h4>
  			<b>Date:</b> 9/20<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 6<br>
  			<b>What did I work on:</b><br>
  			I began looking into the ways I would incorporate location, weather, news and stocks in my UI. I have an initial layout in my memory and this week I am working on integrating the code which Rtvik wrote into my GUI. I have attached a screenshot of the same. I decided to use the same object oriented approach to make sure that all different parts of the UI are in distinct windows and that one part doesn't affect the other.<br>
  <b> What did I learn this week:</b><br>
   I realized that integrating code written by someone else is not easy. I need to completely understand what someone else's code is doing in order to make sure I utilize its full functionality. After having completely understood the code, I was able to decide how I would merge his code with mine in order to have a functional GUI.<br>
  <b>Challenges:</b><br>
  I am still not completely familiar with GUI design and am still learning its full functionality. I need to make sure my GUI will create a UI with appropriate proportions for the mirror and I need to make sure I am able to make the code work by end of this week so that we can work on making the GUI more dynamic.<br>
  <b>Next week plan:</b><br>
  I plan to have the GUI working with the necessary changes I talked about by this week or mid-next week so that I can make sure we have a working prototype and can detect and fix any flaws in our design.

	<h4>Week 6:</h4>
  			<b>Date:</b> 9/27<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 8<br>
  			<b>What did I work on:</b><br>
  			I have incorporated news, quotes, stocks, mail and location in the UI along with date and day. The time clock is updated every second. This is a great initial prototype for the UI as it more or less displays the information which we as users would want to see when we wake up daily.<br>
  <b> What did I learn this week:</b><br>
   As I have mentioned in the previous weeks, I realized that testing and understanding someone else's code completely before merging it with your own is very important as I had to make some vital changes when I tried merging the stocks, news and mail API code which Rtvik had written. This had to do with the way I had written my code and how I would have to incorporate his logic into my own. It was great practice for me.<br>
  <b>Challenges:</b><br>
  I have tried to make the UI as dynamic as possible. However, I haven't dealt with images before in Tkinter and this is a new area which I want to gain experience in. Thus, I will have to go over this area so that I can make the UI more dynamic and eye catchy.<br>
  <b>Next week plan:</b><br>
  I plan to go over working with images in Tkinter so that I can add some images to the UI to make it more dynamic. This is a new area for me and I will have to practice this concept before using it in my code.<br>
