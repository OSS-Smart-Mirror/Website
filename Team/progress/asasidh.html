            <h2>Progress Report for Abhay Sasidharan</h2>

            <h4>Week 2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 08/29/2019 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 06 <br>
            <b>Description of design efforts:</b>
			<br>
			Over the course of Week 2, I worked on conducting research on the best strategies to implement the IntelliFace user interface. 
			I studied a variety of approaches and arrived at the conclusion that creating a web application would be the best strategy. 
			The team is using the NVIDIA Jetson Nano as the dev kit for computationally expensive tasks, such as facial recognition.  
			</br>
			<br>
			The Nano runs the Linux4Tegra operating system. As a result, it would be ideal to create a web app and load it onto the default browser (Chromium). 
			The mirror should be stationed near a wall outlet for power and an ethernet port, since the Jetson Nano does not have wifi capabilies. 
			The UI will display the current date, time, local weather and location; hence, internet connectivity is a necessity for running the different APIs. 
			I currently drew out a very rudimentary sketch of the UI, shown in Figure 1, which places emphasis on the fact that "less is more". 
			The user will be using the mirror to view his/her own reflection while making cursory glances at the smart features. 
			This leads me to believe that including additional features such as email notifications would induce too much clutter into the design.  
			</br>

            		</div>
			<br>
			The room temperature read from the temperature sensor connected to the STM32F0 should not be displayed in the same location on the mirror as the weather data, 
			because the two different temperature readings may lead to confusion.The next steps involve getting acclimated to a web development framework of choice and designing the UI. 
			Most team members have experience in GUI design with PyQt; however, I think designing the UI using Flask or Django would be ideal because the designs that I came across 
			that used these frameworks seemed more slick, such as the one designed by reddit user treacherous_tim shown in Figure 2.
