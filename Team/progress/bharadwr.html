               <h4>Week 1:</h4>
               <b>Date:</b> 8/23<br>
               <b>Total hours:</b> 3<br>
               <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
               Ordered parts necessary for the project, resistor kits, Nvidia Jetson Nano, spare STM32 for contingency, temperature sensor TMP36, Light dependent resistors, looking into IR sensors all on Amazon due to its loose 30 day return policy.
               Received parts with a defective Jetson (SD card could not be read easily), replacing that alone, need to test out individual components next week. Drew up basic sketch of the project, and completed Final Report draft.
               TODO by Week 3: Send expense reports to the ECE business office for part reimbursement.

               <b>Date:</b> 8/29<br>
               <b>Total hours:</b> 10<br>
               <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
               Successfully set up website, and progress report docs for the team. Opened a GitHub organization with all the team members to manage the code at https://github.com/OSS-Smart-Mirror. Successfully flashed the replacement Jetson with a lightweight OS, however requires a more stable power source. Looking into repurposing an old Google Home power adapter which has a stabilizer built in. Begun work with Ishaan on the STM32 interfacing the TM36 using ADC channel 0, but require a heat gun to calibrate/verify the data. Also planned out the UI and set up a Kanban board on the Github organization to track issues and assignees. Assigned tickets on UI development, STM32 USART Interfacing, LDR interfacing, and TMP36 interfacing between the team.
               TODO next week: Look into IEEE PCB workshop/Youtube tutorials to get an estimate of the duration it will take to complete this.

               <h4>Week 3:</h4>
               <strong>Date:</strong> 9/4<br /> <strong>Total hours:</strong> 15<br /> <strong>Description of design efforts:</strong><br /> <strong> What I worked on this week: </strong> Begun work on the STM32 code with ADC channels and timers with interrupt handlers initialization, as well as a start on USART data transmission to the Jetson. This was mostly done on the STM32 SystemWorkbench, with some changes made on the Jetson terminal, namely writing scripts to redirect input data to a file, which can be tailed from the dashboard. <br /> <strong> Things I learned this week: </strong> With USART knowledge on the whole team being a bit rusty, this did not work first time and we spent a good amount of time revising old ECE 362 work, will need to get back to this after some organization on the power source side. I also read up on online API integration with our Tkinter dashboard. <br /> <strong> Challenges: </strong> Connecting the Jetson to a standard power source causes a screen flicker, and at times random shutdowns, need to source a proper part for this from Adafruit, part in consideration being a 5V 2.5A Switching power supply (GEO151UB-6025) and some cheaper alternatives. While there is an associated cost with ordering a dedicated power supply for this, it is of utmost importance that the Jetson's functionality is tip-top. Next steps would be to complete the code for a USART and the CFAL LED display to test the IRQHandlers and the ADC+GPIO reads of all sensors. While not conventional, stepping through the debugger does yield seemingly accurate results, but this does need proper validation using a heat gun with temperature control. <br /> <strong> Next week's tasks: </strong> To obtain and test a more stable power source, either a 5V 2.5A micro-USB or a 5V 4A barrel jack power method to the Jetson, continue progress on the API integration for location, weather, news and tickers. The part in consideration has been displayed below. <br /> <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://developer.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/akamai/embedded/images/jetsonNano/gettingStarted/jetson-nano-dev-kit-power-block-r4-HR.png" width="400" height="350" /> <br /> <br />

               <h4>Week 4:</h4>
                  <b>Date:</b> 9/11<br>
                  <b>Total hours:</b> 8<br>
                  <b>Description of design efforts:</b><br>
                  <b> What I worked on this week: </b> This weeks work was inhibited by the industrial roundtable, but I have managed to complete the Py-News and Weather, Location APIs. We did this using the in-built urllib.requests library for Python3, as well as a Geocoder library that detects the user's address using their IP. The News API required JSON parsing of the BBC newsfeed API to extract headlines only, but this is a light operation considering the API requests only 8 headlines at max.<br> In regards to the temperature sensor testing, a heat gun was deemed as overkill as it may damage the plastics in the TMP36 sensor, and we have decided to use it in a temperature controlled environment and use body temperature from our fingers to detect a change.<br>
                  <b> Things I learned this week: </b> There is an associated cost of operation to running these API requests in the background, and updating the dashboard in the foreground. Careful thread implementation is needed to maximize the untapped potential of the Jetson Nano so far. I also learned that calibrating the TMP36 sensor might be an arduous task without the presence of a controlled low heat gun, due to its unavailability in lab. We will need to spend more time on validating this elsewhere. <br>
                  <b> Challenges: </b> Calibrating the TMP36 sensor is going be an arduous task in the absence of a controlled low heat gun, due to its unavailability in lab. We will need to spend more time on validating this elsewhere. This will need, as mentioned before, a temperature controlled environment like a room with an adjustable thermostat. We are planning to test this in Hawkins hall rooms, as well as using the mean body temperature data to see if the sensor detects our finger's temperature accurately.<br>
                  <b> Next week's tasks: </b> To integrate USART into the STM32 and Jetson, and add the LDR ADC read codes, along with procuring a larger micro SD Card for our Jetson Nano which cannot operate on a 16 GB SD Card. We will also need to add the complete TMP36 sensor circuit as planned below.<br>
